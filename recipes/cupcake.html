			<li>¾ teaspoon baking soda</li>

		<h2>Recipe Instructions</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4.</li>
			<li>
				Put the flour, cocoa powder, sugar, baking powder, a pinch of salt and
				the butter in a free-standing electric mixer with a paddle attachment
				(or use a handheld electric whisk). Beat on a slow speed until you get a
				sandy consistency and everything is combined.
			</li>
			<li>
				Whisk the milk, egg and vanilla extract together in a jug, then slowly
				pour about half into the flour mixture
			</li>
			<li>
				Beat to combine and turn the mixer up to high speed, scraping any
				mixture from the side of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Pour in the
				remaining liquid and continue mixing for a couple more minutes until the
				mixture is smooth. Do not overmix.
			</li>

			<li>
				Spoon the mixture into the paper cases until approximately two-thirds
				full. Bake in a preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the sponge
				bounces back when touched and a skewer inserted into the centre comes
				out clean.
			</li>

			<li>
				Leave the cupcakes to cool slightly in the tray before turning out onto
				a wire cooling rack to cool completely. Meanwhile, make chocolate
				buttercream or plain buttercream and spread it over the cakes with a
				palette knife, or use a piping bag. Scatter over chocolate vermicelli,
				if you like
