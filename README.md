# The Odin-recipe Project

This is the first project in [The Odin Project Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) course.

**You can view my project [here](https://annahcodes.github.io/odin-recipes/).**

The project aims to help implement the HTML and git skills we have learnt so far.

## Topics Covered

- HTML
- Git basics

## Thoughts on the project

This was my first time working with the Git workflow.

I got to practice working with git commands like:

- `git clone`
- `git status`
- `git add`
- `git diff`
- `git log`
- `git commit`
- `git push`

### Challenges

The challenge I faced was figuring out how to write commit messages the right way.

How atomic is 'atomic' when making atomic commits?

### How I solved the challenge
I used the git command `git shortlog` to go through my commit messages and get a feel of which messages were more clear and concise.

Going through the article provided in the lesson also helped.
