# The Odin-recipe Project
This is the first project in [The Odin Project Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) course.

The project aims to help implement the HTML and git skills we have learnt so far.

## Topics Covered
- HTML
- Git basics

## Thoughts on the project
This was my first time working with the Git workflow.

I got to practice working with git commands like:
-  ```git clone```
-  ```git status```
-  ```git add```
-  ```git diff```
-  ```git log```
-  ```git commit```
-  ```git push```



 ### Challenges
 The biggest challenge was figuring out how to write commit messages the right way.

 I was not sure whether I was being to repetitive or committing to many changes.

 I believe I will get the hang of it as I keep building projects.
